# Project 3: Airline Tweet Classifier

This is the third project in my 2-week data challenge focused on building and sharing end-to-end data projects.
Here, I used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify tweets directed at major U.S. airlines as **positive, neutral, or negative**.

## ✈️ Project Overview

Social media is a goldmine for customer feedback — but it’s also messy, unstructured, and fast-moving.
This project explores how machine learning can help businesses automatically detect urgent or negative feedback using tweet text alone.

The pipeline focuses on:

* Cleaning noisy tweet text
* Transforming it for machine learning
* Training a classifier to predict sentiment

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** [Twitter US Airline Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
* **Size:** \~14,600 labeled tweets
* **Labels:** `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* WordCloud

## Steps Taken

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Checked class distribution
   * Visualized frequent complaint words and patterns

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis, and stopwords
   * Tokenized text using NLTK
   * Visualized common words using WordCloud

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Converted sentiment labels to numerical values
   * Transformed tweet text using `TfidfVectorizer`

4. **Modeling**

   * Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier
   * Evaluated performance on a test set using `train_test_split`

5. **Use Case**

   * Airlines or customer service teams can flag negative tweets in real-time
   * Helps prioritize urgent feedback and automate responses

## 📌 Key Insights

* Over 60% of tweets were negative — mostly about delays, cancellations, and poor service
* The classifier was especially good at flagging negative sentiment
* Tweets in the *positive* class were significantly fewer

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Test with more classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM
* Fine-tune text preprocessing to improve accuracy
* Deploy as an API for real-time tweet monitoring
